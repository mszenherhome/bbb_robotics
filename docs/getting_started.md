# Getting Started

This guide describes how to obtain a Buy a BeagleBone Black (BBB) and install software on it so that it can serve as an embedded controller for a semiautonomous mobile robot.
 
## Buy a BeagleBone Black
I like getting them from [adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com).  I usually get a small protective case for the BBB as well.

## Plug it in and start it up!
Follow these [instructions](http://beagleboard.org/getting-started).

## Install Ubuntu
See this [guide](http://elinux.org/BeagleBoardUbuntu)

## (Optional) Buy and Configure Wireless Antennae
This is good because it means the BBB need not be tethered to a computer or router in order to have an internet connection.  Bad news is that more -- and more reliable -- power supply is required.

## Install ROS (the Robotics Operating System)
